# Airbnb-Dynamic-Pricing-recommendation-engine-

This project analyzes Airbnb listings in India to derive pricing insights and create an intelligent recommendation system using data visualization and analytics. The objective is to help Airbnb hosts optimize their pricing based on listing characteristics, guest capacity, location, and other relevant factors.

## Project Objective

To design a dynamic pricing engine using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Power BI dashboarding, and price-related metrics to visualize trends, compare patterns, and suggest optimal price ranges for Airbnb listings in India.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Power BI (for interactive dashboards)
- Microsoft Excel (initial data review and cleanup)
- Jupyter Notebook
  
## Dataset

The data consists of Airbnb listings from major cities in India with the following key columns:

- Address, City
- Superhost Status
- Latitude, Longitude
- Name of Listing
- Guests Capacity
- Price
- Room Type
- Star Ratings

## Key Metrics and KPIs

Implemented as part of the Power BI dashboard:

- Total Listings
- Average Rental Price
- Average Star Rating
- Percentage of Superhost Listings
- Average Guest Capacity

## Dashboard Visuals

### Section 1: KPI Cards

- Total Listings
- Average Price
- Average Star Rating
- Superhost Percentage

## EDA Summary

A Jupyter Notebook (Airbnb.ipynb) performs exploratory analysis including:

- Top cities by listing count
- Distribution of prices
- Relationship between room type and average price
- Impact of superhost status and guest capacity on pricing
- Outlier detection and cleaning

## How to Use

1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Review all visuals and filters across pages.
3. Adjust filters like guest capacity, city, or predicted price range to get actionable insights.
4. Refer to the Airbnb.ipynb folder for in-depth Python-based analysis.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate a machine learning model to predict optimal prices more accurately.
- Automate data refresh and price recommendation pipeline.
- Add deployment options for host-side web apps or mobile dashboards.
